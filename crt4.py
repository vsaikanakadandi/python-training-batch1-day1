---> print(object,sep, end, file, flush)
print has 5 parameters

object ---> the value to be printed is object
sep ---> seperator
Eg
a = 8
b = 9
c = 89
print(a, b, c, sep='$')

end ---> which is used to add string at the end of the value,
#it will not kept the command to stay in same line
Eg :
print(str(a), b, end='%%')
print(str(c))
